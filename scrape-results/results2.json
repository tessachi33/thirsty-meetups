For two Wednesday evenings in a row, you will go through the core aspects of the Scrum Framework. This includes why Scrum works, the key players on each Scrum team, and how product development occurs within Scrum.\n\nRegistration for this event includes both workshop sessions. You can register for the event via Eventbrite.\n\nScrum is an agile way to manage a project, usually software development. Agile software development with Scrum is often perceived as a methodology; but rather than viewing Scrum as methodology, think of it as a framework for managing a process. -Mountain Goat Software\n\nThe Instructor: Austin Richter, Scrum Master\nAustin, a Certified Scrum Master, has been working within the Scrum Framework for two years. Before that he worked as Project Coordinator on a team that was transitioning from a Waterfall approach to Scrum.\n\nSession 1, September 30th: Introduction to Scrum and Building a Backlog \nThe first session will offer an overview/refresher of the Scrum Framework. In this workshop we will explore the differences betwen a Waterfall approach and the Scrum Framework. This will highlight the importance of feedback to a team. We will demonstrate these concepts by constructing a bridge and building backlogs. During the building a backlog activity we will explore the three roles on the Scrum Team.\n\nSession 2, October 7th: Sprint Simulation \nIn this workshop you will build something for a customer using the Scrum process. Through this exercise you will go through each step of the Scrum process and produce the necessary artifacts to be successful in a given Sprint. From building a task board to demonstrating your product to the stakeholders, you will be immersed into the scrum process during the Sprint Simulation.\n\nBy the end of this workshop series you'll have a comprehensive understanding of Scrum.\n\nPart of ChickTech’s mission is to retain women in technology. We intend for this event to build community and add skills to resumes. We encourage anyone who wants to practice the Scrum workflow to register for this event!\n\nDates: September 30th and October 7th\n\nTime: Doors open at 5:30pm and close around 8:30pm. The sessions will run 6-8pm\n\nLocation:\nDeskHub \n334 NW 11th Ave\nPortland, OR 97209\n\nRegistration pays for dinner both evenings, along with the class costs. Any amount left over supports ChickTech: High School.\n\nA big thank you to our event location provider, DeskHub!\n\nChickTech: Career events are open to all genders with a focus on women.\n  "

Do you just like learning about cool new programming languages? If any of these apply to you, come to the PDXRust meetup to learn more and meet others with similar interests!\n\nThis meetup occurs on the first Wednesday of every month, from 6-8pm.\n\nOctober's meeting will be at Mozilla's Portland space.\n\nWhat will happen at the meetup? Good question! That's largely up to attendees!\n\nWe start with 30-50 minutes of lightning talks from anyone who:\n\n• Has built something in Rust that they want to share,\n\n• Wants to build something in Rust and is seeking feedback and collaborators, or\n\n• Has learned something cool about Rust that they think would be useful to others.\n\nAfter the lightning talks, we have about an hour of hack time so you can sit down and work on your Rust project in a room full of others who enjoy the language.\n\nJoin us in #pdxrust on irc.freenode.net (http://webchat.freenode.net/) with any feedback about what you'd like to see!\n\nRemember that Rust's Code of Conduct applies to this event.\n\nLogistics:\n\nParking near the building can be scarce. The Mozilla office is close to the 11th&Couch stop and 10th&Couch stop on the NS streetcar line, and within walking distance of several bus lines. Covered bike parking is available in the courtyard that you cross to get to Mozilla's building, across from the Peet's Coffee and Tea seating area.\n\nThe building is mostly wheelchair-accessible, in that there are no unavoidable stairs and the outside door has an automatic opening switch. Restroom doors on the 3rd floor and Mozilla office door are not automatic.\n\nFood is not yet planned for the event. If your company would like to sponsor food for the meeting, let edunham know (rustpdx@edunham.net, or IRC).\n  "

Tips and tricks that can be shared varied depending on who comes to the event. Things shared at previous events include working with Arduino, programming, sculpting, knitting, hand sewing, misc hobbyist electronics tips from component suppliers to soldering tricks.\n\nAll attendees will need to sign-in with Cat before entering the meetup space.

The space between the intolerable “before” and the ideal “after” is your project’s “improvement trajectory.” And once this is defined, it’s easier to identify key moments in the customer journey and match them to design patterns.\n\nSamuel shares strategies that help you stop hemorrhaging signups. You’ll learn to create quality onboarding experiences that target your users’ frustrations and move them from A to B in their lives, instead of just A to B in your app.\n\nAbout Samuel\n\nSamuel Hulick runs UserOnboard.com and is the author of The Elements of User Onboarding. He’s combined UX savvy and a cat-like curiosity for measuring UX impact to become an expert in onboarding. His approach is shaped by over a decade of web experience, theories taken from behavioral psychology, cognitive development, video game design, and even filmmaking.\n  "
