The space between the intolerable “before” and the ideal “after” is your project’s “improvement trajectory.” And once this is defined, it’s easier to identify key moments in the customer journey and match them to design patterns.\n\nSamuel shares strategies that help you stop hemorrhaging signups. You’ll learn to create quality onboarding experiences that target your users’ frustrations and move them from A to B in their lives, instead of just A to B in your app.\n\nAbout Samuel\n\nSamuel Hulick runs UserOnboard.com and is the author of The Elements of User Onboarding. He’s combined UX savvy and a cat-like curiosity for measuring UX impact to become an expert in onboarding. His approach is shaped by over a decade of web experience, theories taken from behavioral psychology, cognitive development, video game design, and even filmmaking.\n  "

Scott is also one of the keynote speakers for the PNSQC’s October events and will be tailoring his presentation specifically for SQAUG!\n\nAbout our speaker: Scott Poole is most well known as the “House Poet” on the weekly Live Wire! public radio variety show, taped in Portland and broadcast nationally by Public Radio International. However, he is also a software developer. Currently, he’s the Senior Web Developer for Columbia United Providers in Vancouver, WA. He’s been writing code for 9 years and poetry for 25.

Meanwhile, knowledgable, enthusiastic, and bright junior candidates are chomping at the bit, waiting for their opportunity to be recognized for their unique talents.\n\nThis talk will explore pieces to the puzzle that will help transform this new influx of juniors from \"green\" to \"lean, mean, coding machines,\" consequently making them invaluable members of your team. However, this can only be accomplished if both parties are equally invested in the process.\n\nOur speaker, Amy Vaillancourt-Sals\n\n\nA professional-musician-turned-developer, Amy graduated from Epicodus (a Portland-based programming bootcamp) and landed a job at ThinkShout where she builds creative web solutions for non-profit organizations. Previous work includes being a community relations specialist for the online music tech companies, Discogs and Bandcamp. When she’s not coding, or actively striving to make the world a better place, she can be found swinging from a high-flying trapeze, or kiteboarding down the Columbia river.\n  "

Cat and Watershed PDX team up to offer just the space!\n\nWe will supply wifi, and a place to share ideas and collaborate with a community of fellow creators and makers. We'll share tips and tricks, and support your creative endeavors! The goal for the meetup is to support the local creative scene while providing an opportunity for people to build a network with people of varied skills. Makers, crafters, and creators of all ages, skill levels, and backgrounds are encouraged to bring your projects, supplies, and ideas.\n\nFrom sewing to electronics to art projects, this will be an incubator for interesting collaborations. For example, if someone comes in to work on an embroidery project, another could show them how to incorporate conductive thread and LEDs to make that project light up. Tips and tricks that can be shared varied depending on who comes to the event. Things shared at previous events include working with Arduino, programming, sculpting, knitting, hand sewing, misc hobbyist electronics tips from component suppliers to soldering tricks.\n\nAll attendees will need to sign-in with Cat before entering the meetup space. All information will be kept confidential.\n\nBy attending this event you agree that neither Watershed nor myself is liable for any injury you may receive while working on your project, and that you will follow the Code of Conduct.\n  "
